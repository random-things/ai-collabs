# **SparseHash Wheel**

**Concept:**
The SparseHash Wheel is a probabilistic data structure designed to efficiently track approximate frequencies of elements in high-volume streaming data, with surprisingly accurate cardinality estimation, rapid membership testing, and low memory consumption. It leverages the mathematical property of **modular cyclic hashing** combined with the statistical distribution of prime number residues to efficiently differentiate distinct elements.

### Status: 🚫

Assumptions do not hold as proposed. Might be viable, but would require substantial changes.

---

### **Core Mathematical Property:**

This data structure exploits the properties of modular arithmetic with carefully chosen prime moduli. It uses multiple prime-sized circular buffers ("wheels") arranged in layers, each layer using different prime moduli. Due to the well-known property that hashing uniformly distributes elements across residue classes modulo prime numbers, this structure cleverly exploits this uniformity to simultaneously achieve accurate frequency estimation and fast cardinality estimation.

---

### **Structure Overview:**

* Consists of multiple layers, each layer is a wheel (circular buffer) of size equal to a prime number.
* Each wheel stores compact counters (e.g., 4-bit or 8-bit).
* Each incoming item is hashed, and its residue mod each wheel's prime number determines the slot to increment.
* Periodically, wheels rotate their starting index, shifting and decaying old counts to maintain recent frequency accuracy.

---

### **Operations:**

* **Insert(item):**

  1. Hash the item once.
  2. Increment counters at positions determined by residue mod prime at each wheel layer.

* **QueryFrequency(item):**

  1. Return the minimum counter value across layers for the item's hashed residues, giving an upper bound frequency estimation.

* **Cardinality():**

  1. Uses statistical inference across wheels based on non-zero counter density to estimate total unique elements, leveraging prime-number modular uniformity and harmonic distribution properties.

* **MembershipQuery(item, frequency\_threshold):**

  1. Checks if the estimated frequency of an item exceeds a given threshold.

---

### **Surprising Performance Benefit:**

* **Reduced Collisions via Prime Moduli:**
  By choosing wheel sizes as prime numbers, the data structure evenly distributes collisions across each wheel. Prime moduli avoid the periodic collision clustering common in power-of-two sized arrays, providing unexpectedly low frequency-estimation error rates.

* **Efficient Cardinality Estimation:**
  Exploiting uniform residue distributions modulo prime numbers, the SparseHash Wheel can infer cardinality with minimal additional overhead. Unlike conventional solutions like HyperLogLog, this integrates cardinality estimation directly into the structure without extra components.

* **Memory Efficiency through Cyclic Decay:**
  Wheels periodically rotate to automatically decay older frequency counts, naturally prioritizing recent data streams without explicit time-stamping.

---

### **Broad Applicability:**

* Real-time analytics of large-scale event streams.
* Network intrusion detection (tracking IP addresses and event frequencies).
* Clickstream analysis for websites.
* IoT sensor data aggregation.
* Database query caching decisions (identifying frequently queried elements efficiently).
* Distributed logging systems.

---

### **Complexity Analysis (Surprising and Advantageous):**

* **Insert Complexity:** O(1) constant-time, single hash computation and fixed number of modulo operations.
* **Frequency Query Complexity:** O(1) constant-time, minimum of a few integer lookups.
* **Cardinality Estimation Complexity:** O(1), leveraging simple arithmetic operations on counter densities.
* **Memory Consumption:** Surprisingly low due to small integer counters and natural decay from cyclic rotation.

### **Example Implementation (Simplified Pseudocode):**

```python
class SparseHashWheel:
    def __init__(self, prime_sizes):
        self.wheels = [ [0]*p for p in prime_sizes ]
        self.primes = prime_sizes
        self.offsets = [0]*len(prime_sizes)

    def _hash(self, item):
        return hash(item)

    def insert(self, item):
        h = self._hash(item)
        for i, prime in enumerate(self.primes):
            pos = (h % prime + self.offsets[i]) % prime
            if self.wheels[i][pos] < 255:
                self.wheels[i][pos] += 1

    def query_frequency(self, item):
        h = self._hash(item)
        return min(
            self.wheels[i][(h % prime + self.offsets[i]) % prime]
            for i, prime in enumerate(self.primes)
        )

    def estimate_cardinality(self):
        densities = [
            sum(1 for count in wheel if count > 0) / prime
            for wheel, prime in zip(self.wheels, self.primes)
        ]
        harmonic_mean_density = len(densities) / sum(1/d for d in densities if d > 0)
        return -sum(self.primes) * math.log(1 - harmonic_mean_density)
```

### **Why This Structure is Novel:**

* It creatively combines modular arithmetic with probabilistic counting, an innovation rarely seen explicitly combined in existing frequency or cardinality estimation structures.
* The interplay of prime-number arithmetic and cyclic buffer mechanics yields a naturally decaying, self-managing, low-collision structure, providing an unexpected, measurable performance and accuracy boost over conventional alternatives (Bloom filters, Count-Min Sketch, HyperLogLog).
* Its elegant integration of cardinality estimation into frequency counting significantly reduces complexity, cost, and overhead.

**Testing SparseHash Wheel assumptions**

The user wants to test assumptions related to the SparseHash Wheel data structure using Python. I’ve already defined it as a probabilistic structure using modular cyclic hashing with prime wheels. Now, I need to write Python code to test these assumptions:

1. Verify uniform distribution of residues modulo prime by hashing random items.
2. Test frequency estimation error, maybe using Count-min style.
3. For cardinality, use density to estimate and measure error against the actual count.

I’ll generate a data stream, update the wheel, query frequencies and cardinality, then measure errors.

| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Collision uniformity (χ² on first wheel, 1009 buckets)**   | χ² ≈ 1.7 × 10⁶ (far above 1008 d.o.f. expectation of ≈1008) | The built‑in Blake2b hash combined with a skewed (Zipf s = 1.1) stream produced **severe bucket imbalance**—the uniform‑residue assumption isn’t satisfied in practice. |
| **Frequency‑estimate accuracy** (2 000 random keys)<br>mean  |  8.4 counts, max 77 (true counts range 1 … 3 000)           | Error is modest for heavy hitters but non‑negligible; still bigger than the theoretical “min(counter values)” bound usually promised for count‑min sketches.            |
| **Cardinality estimate**                                     | 17 097 vs true 5 535 (≈ +210 %)                             | The simple “harmonic density” formula substantially **over‑estimates** unique count on skewed data.                                                                     |

### What the code verified

1. **Implementation correctness** – inserts and queries ran without overflow; counters capped at 65 535.
2. **Collision distribution** – real hash+data violates the “uniform mod p” lemma.
3. **Frequency upper‑bound** – min‑of‑wheels remains an upper bound, but practical error is non‑trivial.
4. **Cardinality formula** – large bias under realistic skew.

### Engineering verdict

*The SparseHash Wheel’s mathematical assumptions (uniform residues → unbiased density, harmonic mean → accurate distinct‑count) do not hold under typical hash + skew combinations.*
Extra calibration, bias correction, or different hash mixing would be required to make it competitive with matured structures such as Count‑Min Sketch (for frequencies) or HyperLogLog (for cardinality).
